# Linear Regression Model for Bike Rental Demand Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on building and optimizing a **Linear Regression Model** using **gradient descent** to predict bike rental demand. The dataset is carefully chosen to align with our mission while avoiding generic use cases such as house price prediction. Additionally, the model's performance is compared against **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests**.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains bike rental data, which includes features such as:
- **Weather conditions** (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.)
- **Time-related factors** (hour, weekday, month, season)
- **Past rental trends** (number of rentals on previous days)

The dataset was sourced from **[Kaggle, Google Datasets, or data.gov]**, ensuring its relevance and reliability.

## Project Tasks

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Acquire a dataset related to bike rental demand.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and relationships.
- Handle missing values, feature scaling, and categorical encoding where necessary.

### 2. Model Development
- Implement **Linear Regression** using **scikit-learn** and **gradient descent** optimization.
- Train the model using a portion of the dataset and evaluate it on a test set.
- Plot the **loss curve** for both train and test data to visualize convergence.

### 3. Model Comparison
- Train and compare the performance of the following models:
  - **Linear Regression** (our primary model)
  - **Decision Trees**
  - **Random Forest**
- Evaluate models using appropriate loss metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared score).
- Select the best-performing model based on the evaluation.

### 4. Model Saving & Prediction Script
- Save the best-performing model.
- Create a Python script that allows predictions using the saved model.
- The script will take in new input values (such as weather conditions and time) and predict bike rental demand.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Running the Project
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Train and evaluate the models.
3. Save the best model.
4. Use the prediction script to make forecasts.

## Expected Outcome
- A well-optimized **Linear Regression Model** for bike rental demand prediction.
- Comparison results between **Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest**.
- A functional script for making predictions based on new data.
